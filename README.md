### snp_array_analysis


##### These are isolated modules to perform one task at a time (e.g. trimming reads, aligning reads etc), this is to make sure we don't have too big work directory in Eddie scratch workspace
##### Clone the directory for each task, it will come along with the nextflow executable as well as the module file (trim.nf, for example)
