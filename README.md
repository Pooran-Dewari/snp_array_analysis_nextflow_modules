### snp_array_analysis


- These are isolated nextflow modules to perform one task at a time (e.g. trimming reads, aligning reads etc), this is just to get working with limited storage and avoid creating too big work directory
- Clone the directory for each task, it will come along with the nextflow executable as well as the module file (trim.nf, for example)
- these are also (in my humble & biased opinion!!) nice small scripts to learn nextflow language
